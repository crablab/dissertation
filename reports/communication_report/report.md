# Communication methods for attendance monitoring 

At Royal Holloway, for the 2018 intake of first year undergraduates it was decided that due to the class size, paper registers were infeasible. The clicker system was proposed and developed which has been discussed in previous reports; particularly with regard to the system security. The key advantage of the clicker system was that it did not rely on the signature of students (it used a wireless electronic device) and therefore did not require the laborious administration overheard of transposing the signatures into an electronic database. Fundamentally, it was not more secure and this element of an improved system will be discussed in a future report. 

One of the key advantages that the clicker system had over the registers was that it utilise wireless communication such that students could 'click in' on a short range handheld device, rather than pass around a physical register sheet. The range of the clickers is advertised as being around a 200ft radius[@noauthor_c21_nodate] which in the context of a lecture theatre, is actually quite large! Based on practical experience (and not wishing to go down a rabbit hole to find out definitively), I postulate that for most lecture theatres that would include the entire room plus a short distance outside - taking into account the attenuation of the signal through the walls. 

Considering the range of other wireless communication technologies: 
- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID): a maximum of 20ft[@nikitin_performance_2006] with a passive tag. 
- Near Field Communication (NFC): a few centimeters[@fischer_nfc_2009]
