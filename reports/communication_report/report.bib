	abstract = {Near-field communications (NFC) promises to create a whole new paradigm for the vast majority of cell phone users and is emerging as a near-term reality. What has been described as the confluence of RFID and cellular telephony will bring with it a wealth of new applications. The applications space, security mechanisms, and human interface are maturing; the service providers and payment companies are working to keep pace with these new capabilities; and it is starting to be incorporated into the new generation of cell phone designs. With NFC, our favorite electronic companion essentially becomes our magic wand. The basic "wand" premise is that it indicates intent. When you point, where you point, or at whom you point, tells the machine piece of the human-machine interface much about what it is supposed to do.},
