What has been described as the confluence of RFID and cellular telephony will bring with it a wealth of new applications. The applications space, security mechanisms, and human interface are maturing; the service providers and payment companies are working to keep pace with these new capabilities; and it is starting to be incorporated into the new generation of cell phone designs. With NFC, our favorite electronic companion essentially becomes our magic wand. The basic "wand" premise is that it indicates intent. When you point, where you point, or at whom you point, tells the machine piece of the human-machine interface much about what it is supposed to do.},

	abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an emerging low-power wireless technology developed for short-range control and monitoring applications that is expected to be incorporated into billions of devices in the next few years. This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 µs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},

In this article we give a brief overview of the MIFARE Classic card, its use, design and security. We start by looking at the range of card and RFID products and placing the MIFARE Classic in its intended position. The process of risk assessment is then discussed as a means of choosing “appropriate” products and solutions. We then discuss the history of the MIFARE Classic, its design, security features and associated attacks. The long-lasting effects of the attacks and publicity are considered with respect to not only the MIFARE Classic, but for similar product risk reviews.},

	abstract = {The security of embedded devices often relies on the secrecy of proprietary cryptographic algorithms. These algorithms and their weaknesses are frequently disclosed through reverse-engineering software, but it is commonly thought to be too expensive to reconstruct designs from a hardware implementation alone. This paper challenges that belief by presenting an approach to reverse-engineering a cipher from a silicon implementation. Using this mostly automated approach, we reveal a cipher from an RFID tag that is not known to have a software or micro-code implementation. We reconstruct the cipher from the widely used Mifare Classic RFID tag by using a combination of image analysis of circuits and protocol analysis. Our analysis reveals that the security of the tag is even below the level that its 48-bit key length suggests due to a number of design ﬂaws. Weak random numbers and a weakness in the authentication protocol allow for pre-computed rainbow tables to be used to ﬁnd any key in a matter of seconds. Our approach of deducing functionality from circuit images is mostly automated, hence it is also feasible for large chips. The assumption that algorithms can be kept secret should therefore to be avoided for any type of silicon chip.},
