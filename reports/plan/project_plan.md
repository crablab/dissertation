# Abstract
### An overview of the aims and objectives for the project;

Royal Holloway keeps track of attendance in lectures both to ensure that students are regularly attending and also to satisfy legal requirements regarding the visas of overseas students. It is essential that this data is gathered and analysed efficiently and accurately.

In the past attendance has been tracked using signatures on registers. More recently, due to the lack of scalability of this former approach, a system of clickers has been employed. This latter system has proved to be non-optimal and insecure. 

The aim of this research is to investigate existing attendance monitoring solutions and existing academic research into the problem to determine a more optimal solution for Royal Holloway. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will be built to test assumptions and demonstrate the core ideas of the proposed solution. 

The system will need to be user friendly and satisfy Royal Holloway's requirements whilst also not becoming burdensome on lecturers, students and administrative staff. 

In 2003 Jones and Rickenbacker applied for a patent relating to an attendance monitoring system for employers.[@jones_attendance_2003]
