# Abstract 

<!-- 1. A section motivating the project and giving the original project aims.
This section must include a description of how you think that the work involved in your
project will help in your future career. -->

# Introduction 

## Motivation 

# Research 

<!-- 6. A theory section. This might include a literature survey, sections on specific theory,
or even an interesting discussion on what you have achieved in a more global context. -->

## Background Theory 

## Clicker: reverse engineering 

## Browser Fingerprinting 

## Bluetooth 

## Signing and authentication

# Design and Software Engineering

<!-- 7. Sections describing the software engineering method that you used. If your project is
based on a software product then this may even be most of your report. -->

# Professional Issues

<!-- 2. A short section on professional issues (See Section 6) that raised concern during the
year, particularly with respect to doing your project or the material contained in your
project. -->

<!-- Ethical behaviour is concerned with what is good or bad, with moral duty and obligation and
as such deals with opinions and beliefs.
Professionalism in computing is concerned with the societal impact of computer technology
and the creation and understanding of policies for the ethical use of such technologies.
Professional bodies such as the British Computer Society (BCS) and the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) help ensure professionalism and ethical behaviour by providing
standards and a code of individual conduct: guaranteeing certain levels of competence, integrity
and a commitment to the interests of all end-users and other stakeholders.

"I am amazed when I meet computer professionals in business and industry or even
computer science teachers in colleges and universities who fail to recognise that their
profession has social and ethical consequences" Terrell Ward Bynum (2003 )

After completing a Royal Holloway Computer Science degree we expect that you will be
ready to be ethical computing professionals. To this end we include material on professional
issues in our undergraduate modules.
The individual project is no exception. By completing an individual project, as well as
the theory and practise essential to your chosen topic, you will have acquired skills in time
management, prioritisation and both oral and written presentation.
Certainly you will have encountered some professional issues: correct citation, licensing,
accessibility etc., -->

# Assessment 

## Outcomes

## Issues encountered

## Self-evaluation 

<!-- 3. Some sort of self-evaluation in the assessment section: How did the project go? Where
next? What did you do right/wrong? What have you learnt about doing a project? -->

# Software Deliverables 

<!-- 4. A description of how to run any software that you have submitted, including any
environmental requirements (Java version number, IOS version etc.,) 
User manual in appendix
-->


8. Lastly there are some added extras you might want to include. Perhaps parts of a program
listing. Perhaps some sample output or experimental results. Often you will include
a user manual (though complete installation and operating instructions are mandatory).
These extra documents may be put into an appropriate appendix so as not to count towards
the word limit.

# Bibiography 

<!-- 5. A bibliography of works referred to in the text, or that have been read in order to
understand the project. -->

# Appendix 

<!--
• Long or complicated test output (referred to in the report).
• Examples showing the use of the project.
• Detailed instructions for executing submitted programs.
• Copies of papers and other reference material used for the project.
It is usual to include such material in the appendix to the final report. -->
