Travis Goodspeed details some of the inter-workings of the Turning Point ResponseCard RF in his blog. He found out that the device always sends it’s answer to the MAC address 0x123456. Then the payload itself is preambled with the clickers MAC address and then the user input, which is ascii 0 through 9 or a question mark. Finally the packet is terminated with a 2-byte CRC.},

Concern regarding the potential cost of Tier 2 and 4 sponsorship of EEA and Swiss applicants was therefore one of the catalysts behind this research.The other principal objective was to gather information, data and case studies to aid the Government’s consultation on its immigration White Paper published in December 2018.The publication of this White Paper andthe twelve-month consultation period which follows, represent a welcome opportunity to contribute to the development of immigration policy at a crucial juncture as the UK leaves the EU. We are glad to have assisted the Russell Group in this important research and trust that the findings of this report will play a useful role -informing both the consultation and future policy objectives.The UK must ensure that overseas students and university staff continue to be welcomed and supported whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The universities themselves –and the immigration programmes they run –remain at the heart of this endeavou},
