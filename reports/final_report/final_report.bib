Diverse automatic identification technologies have been more in vogue such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). An extensive research and several applications are produced to take maximum advantage of this technology and bring about some concerns. RFID is a wireless technology which uses to a purpose of identifying and tracking an object via radio waves to transfer data from an electronic tag, called RFID tag or label to send data to RFID reader. The current study focuses on proposing an RFID based Attendance Management System (AMS) and also information service system for an academic domain by using RFID technology in addition to the programmable Logic Circuit (such as Arduino), and web-based application. The proposed system aims to manage student’s attendance recording and provides the capabilities of tracking student absentee as well, supporting information services include students grading marks, daily timetable, lectures time and classroom numbers, and other student-related instructions provided by faculty department staff. Based on the results, the proposed attendance and information system is time-effective and it reduces the documentation efforts as well as, it does not have any power consumption. Besides, students attendance RFID based systems that have been proposed are also analyzed and criticized respect to systems functionalities and main findings. Future directions for further researchers are focused and identified.},

Automated systems involving use of biometrics like fingerprint and iris recognition are well developed in the recent years however, it is intrusive and cost required for deployment on large scale gets increased substantially. To overcome these issues, biometric feature like facial recognition can be used which involves the phases such as image acquisition, face detection, feature extraction, face classification, face recognition and eventually marking the attendance. The algorithms like Viola-Jones and HOG features along with SVM classifier are used to acquire the desired results. Various real time scenarios need to be considered such as scaling, illumination, occlusions and pose. The problem of redundancy in manual records and keeping attendance is solved by this system.

	abstract = {Attendance management is important to every single organization; it can decide whether or not an organization such as educational institutions, public or private sectors will be successful in the future. Organizations will have to keep a track of people within the organization such as employees and students to maximize their performance. Managing student attendance during lecture periods has become a difficult challenge. The ability to compute the attendance percentage becomes a major task as manual computation produces errors, and wastes a lot of time. For the stated reason, an efficient Web-based application for attendance management system is designed to track student's activity in the class. This application takes attendance electronically and the records of the attendance are storing in a database. The system design using the Model, View, and Controller (MVC) architecture, and implemented using the power of Laravel Framework. JavaScript is adding to the application to improve the use of the system. MySQL used for the Application Database. The system designed in a way that can differentiate the hours of theoretical and practical lessons since the rate of them is different for calculating the percentages of the students' absence. Insertions, deletions, and changes of data in the system can do straightforward via the designed GUI without interacting with the tables. Different presentation of information is obtainable from the system. The test case of the system exposed that the system is working enormously and is ready to use to manage to attend students for any department of the University. INTRODUCTION Due to student's interest in classrooms, and whose is the largest union in the study environment of university or institution, so recording absence at a department having a large number of students in a classroom is a difficult task and time-consuming. Moreover, the process takes much time, and many efforts are spent by the staff of the department to complete the attendance rates for each student. So in many institutions and academic organizations, attendance is a very important criterion which is used for various purposes. These purposes include record keeping, assessment of students, and promotion of optimal and consistent attendance in class. As long as in many developing countries, a minimum percentage of class attendance is required in most institutions and this policy has not been adhered to, because of the various challenges the present method of taking attendance presents. The process of recording attendances for students was in the form of hardcopy papers and the system was manually done. Besides wasting time and taking efforts for preparing sheets and documents, other disadvantages may be visible to the traditional one due to loss or damage to the sheets-sheet could be stolen.},

The user can select a button labeled 1-9 and 0, or A-J and the clicker will send the result to the hub which collects all of the responses. Travis Goodspeed details some of the inter-workings of the Turning Point ResponseCard RF in his blog. He found out that the device always sends it’s answer to the MAC address 0x123456. Then the payload itself is preambled with the clickers MAC address and then the user input, which is ascii 0 through 9 or a question mark. Finally the packet is terminated with a 2-byte CRC.},

	doi = {10.1109/RFID.2009.4911199},
	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a rapidly developing wireless communication technology for electronically identifying, locating, and tracking products, assets, and personnel. RFID has become one of the primarily means to construct a real-time locating system (RTLS) that tracks and identifies the location of objects in real time using simple, inexpensive tags attached to or embedded in objects and readers that receive the wireless signals from these tags to determine their locations. Most RFID tag localization techniques heavily rely on precise estimation of the range between a reader and the tags. Traditionally, range information is obtained from the received signal strength indication (RSSI). Such approach is inaccurate, particularly in a complicated propagation environment. Recent development on phase difference of arrival (PDOA) allows coherent signal processing for improved range estimation performance. Exploiting multiple frequencies may further improve the range estimation performance. In this paper, we focus on multifrequency-based techniques to achieve several important advantages in the range estimation of passive or semi-passive RFID tags. The use of well designed multiple frequencies allows effective phase upwrapping and elimination of the range ambiguity problem which may be encountered in PDOA methods. In a complicated propagation environment, the mutifrequency-based techniques provide frequency diversity for robust range estimation when signals are highly faded at some frequencies. These advantages not only yield improved range estimation accuracy of RFID tags in various applications, but also enable robust range estimation in challenging scenarios.},

What has been described as the confluence of RFID and cellular telephony will bring with it a wealth of new applications. The applications space, security mechanisms, and human interface are maturing; the service providers and payment companies are working to keep pace with these new capabilities; and it is starting to be incorporated into the new generation of cell phone designs. With NFC, our favorite electronic companion essentially becomes our magic wand. The basic "wand" premise is that it indicates intent. When you point, where you point, or at whom you point, tells the machine piece of the human-machine interface much about what it is supposed to do.},

We start by looking at the range of card and RFID products and placing the MIFARE Classic in its intended position. The process of risk assessment is then discussed as a means of choosing “appropriate” products and solutions. We then discuss the history of the MIFARE Classic, its design, security features and associated attacks. The long-lasting effects of the attacks and publicity are considered with respect to not only the MIFARE Classic, but for similar product risk reviews.},

We show that we can achieve a significant performance of 35.3 and 6 ms for signing and verification, respectively, at a 128-bit security level on an ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller. This shows that lattice-based cryptography can be efficiently deployed on today's hardware and provides security solutions for many use cases that can even withstand future threats.},

Unlike the ordinary discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem, no subexponential-time algorithm is known for the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. For this reason, the strength-per-key-bit is substantially greater in an algorithm that uses elliptic curves.

	abstract = {The techniques of tracking users through their web browsers have greatly evolved since the birth of the World Wide Web, posing an increasingly significant privacy risk. An important branch of these methods, called fingerprinting, is getting more and more attention, because it does not rely on client-side information storage, in contrast to cookie-like techniques. In this paper, we propose a new, browser-independent fingerprinting method. We have tested it on a data set of almost a thousand records, collected through a publicly accessible test website. We have shown that a part of the IP address, the availability of a specific font set, the time zone, and the screen resolution are enough to uniquely identify most users of the five most popular web browsers, and that user agent strings are fairly effective but fragile identifiers of a browser instance.},

We implemented one possible ﬁngerprinting algorithm, and collected these ﬁngerprints from a large sample of browsers that visited our test side, panopticlick.eff.org. We observe that the distribution of our ﬁngerprint contains at least 18.1 bits of entropy, meaning that if we pick a browser at random, at best we expect that only one in 286,777 other browsers will share its ﬁngerprint. Among browsers that support Flash or Java, the situation is worse, with the average browser carrying at least 18.8 bits of identifying information. 94.2\% of browsers with Flash or Java were unique in our sample.},

In order to prove the usefulness of FPTracker, we have evaluated the top 10,000 European websites (according to Alexa.com) that comprise 1,393,426 links. We have chosen popular European websites to discern how these websites employ user tracking third parties concerning the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Accordingly, we found that 117,012 links out of 1,393,426 use invisible user fingerprinting systems.

	abstract = {Based on the rapidly trending field of Location-Based Services, Gateways which are important components of the internet of Things (IoT) are designed to rely on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of devices at the desired venue in order to locate and track them. However, Apple and similarly Android manufacturers have adopted the strategy of MAC address randomization such that their users' privacy would not be compromised in any sort. This paper, pursued the goal of studying the behavior of MAC Address randomization in iOS devices, finding an answer for the following key question: “What does randomized MAC addresses mean for BLE-based Location Tracking and Analytics?” and investigating potential solutions to overcome this challenge and to keep track of all devices at a target venue, while respecting users' privacy. As per our studies, two main approaches are suggested, adopting each will enable Gateways to cope with the MAC address randomization strategies of the iOS devices. The first suggestion is an extension of tracking algorithm, relying on the fact that the frequency of MAC Address randomization is low enough for to keep track of the devices present at the venue, based on the first detected MAC address and its associated device, and the second proposed approach is to incorporate other data fields of the advertised Probe Requests from a target device to enhance localization performance.},

	abstract = {It is possible to relay signals between a contactless EMV card and a shop’s EMV reader and so make a fraudulent payment without the card-owner’s knowledge. Existing countermeasures rely on proximity checking: the reader will measure round trip times in message-exchanges, and rejects replies that take longer than expected (which suggests they have been relayed). However, it is the reader that would receive the illicit payment from any relayed transaction, so a rogue reader has little incentive to enforce the required checks. Furthermore, cases of malware targeting point-of-sales systems are common. We propose three novel proximity-checking protocols that use a trusted platform module (TPM) to ensure that the reader performs the time measurements correctly. After running one of our proposed protocols, the bank can be sure that the card and reader were in close proximity, even if the reader tries to subvert the protocol. Our ﬁrst protocol makes changes to the cards and readers, our second protocol modiﬁes the readers and the banking backend, and our third protocol allows the detection of relay attacks, after they have happened, with only changes to the readers.},

This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 µs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},

	abstract = {The security of embedded devices often relies on the secrecy of proprietary cryptographic algorithms. These algorithms and their weaknesses are frequently disclosed through reverse-engineering software, but it is commonly thought to be too expensive to reconstruct designs from a hardware implementation alone. This paper challenges that belief by presenting an approach to reverse-engineering a cipher from a silicon implementation. Using this mostly automated approach, we reveal a cipher from an RFID tag that is not known to have a software or micro-code implementation. We reconstruct the cipher from the widely used Mifare Classic RFID tag by using a combination of image analysis of circuits and protocol analysis. Our analysis reveals that the security of the tag is even below the level that its 48-bit key length suggests due to a number of design ﬂaws. Weak random numbers and a weakness in the authentication protocol allow for pre-computed rainbow tables to be used to ﬁnd any key in a matter of seconds. Our approach of deducing functionality from circuit images is mostly automated, hence it is also feasible for large chips. The assumption that algorithms can be kept secret should therefore to be avoided for any type of silicon chip.},
