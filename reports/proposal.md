# Aims

Analyse existing attendence monitoring solutions in use, research other systems and technologies that can be harnessed for attendence monotoiring and develop an MVP example of a secure and trustworthy attendence monitoring solution.

# Background 

Royal Holloway keeps track of attendence in lectures both to ensure that students are regulaly attending and also to satisfy legal requirements regarding the visas of overseas students. It is essential that this data is gathered and analysed efficiently and accurately.

In the past attendence has been tracked using signatures on registers. More recently, due to the lack of scalablilty of this former approach, a system of clickers has been employed. This latter system has proved to be non-optimal and insecure. 

A user friendly system needs to be built that satisfies Royal Holloway's requirements and are not burdonsome on lecturers, students and admin staff. This is a challenging task and this project intends to explore the issues surrounding that and design a better system to meet these users needs. 

# Early Deliverables

- A report detailing analysis of the existing clicker system compared to the register system exploring security and usability issues with both systems including a proof of concept program demonstrating how to manipulate the clicker system using cheap, off the shelf hardware.
- A report looking at effective means for attendence monitoring covering existing solutions and technical methods to ensure trustworthiness and security. This will cover analysis of technologies such as smartcards, magstripe, on-device authentication etc. to present an overview of the landscape and potential solutions for the University. 
- A proof of concept program using the Web Bluetooth API to allow a device to connect to another device and transmit data from one webpage to the other, over bluetooth. This will include an analysis of the technology and potential other solutions. 
- A proof of concept method of confirming attendence using existing crytographic solutions including an analysis of the options available (ie. OTP, PKI, PGP Signing etc.) and the proposed solution. 
- A draft document utilising findings from the aforementioned reports describing the proposed overall solution, the user stories it solves as well as a full design description of the proposed system including UML. 

# Final deliverables
- A completed project specification outlining the technical design of the system, the user stories it solves and which aspects of the existing solutions it improves. 
- An MVP attendance monitoring system as described in the project system. This will allow students to register attendence for a lecture and include basic analysis/data export by staff members. 
- Full documentation for the system built including installation and running instructions
