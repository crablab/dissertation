	abstract = {The techniques of tracking users through their web browsers have greatly evolved since the birth of the World Wide Web, posing an increasingly significant privacy risk. An important branch of these methods, called fingerprinting, is getting more and more attention, because it does not rely on client-side information storage, in contrast to cookie-like techniques. In this paper, we propose a new, browser-independent fingerprinting method. We have tested it on a data set of almost a thousand records, collected through a publicly accessible test website. We have shown that a part of the IP address, the availability of a specific font set, the time zone, and the screen resolution are enough to uniquely identify most users of the five most popular web browsers, and that user agent strings are fairly effective but fragile identifiers of a browser instance.},

We implemented one possible ﬁngerprinting algorithm, and collected these ﬁngerprints from a large sample of browsers that visited our test side, panopticlick.eff.org. We observe that the distribution of our ﬁngerprint contains at least 18.1 bits of entropy, meaning that if we pick a browser at random, at best we expect that only one in 286,777 other browsers will share its ﬁngerprint. Among browsers that support Flash or Java, the situation is worse, with the average browser carrying at least 18.8 bits of identifying information. 94.2\% of browsers with Flash or Java were unique in our sample.},

In order to prove the usefulness of FPTracker, we have evaluated the top 10,000 European websites (according to Alexa.com) that comprise 1,393,426 links. We have chosen popular European websites to discern how these websites employ user tracking third parties concerning the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Accordingly, we found that 117,012 links out of 1,393,426 use invisible user fingerprinting systems. For instance, one of the biggest European banks and a leading advertising website still fingerprint their visitors.},
