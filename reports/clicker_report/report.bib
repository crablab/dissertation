	abstract = {nRF2401  is  a  single-chip  radio  transceiver  for  the  world  wide  2.4  -  2.5  GHz  ISMband.  The  transceiver  consists  of  a  fully  integrated  frequency  synthesizer,  a  poweramplifier,  a  crystal  oscillator  and  a  modulator.  Output  power  and  frequency  channelsare easily programmable by use of the 3-wire serial interface. Current consumption isvery  low,  only  10.5mA  at  an  output  power  of  -5dBm  and  18mA  in  receive  mode.Built-in Power Down modes makes power saving easily realizable.},

	url = {https://www-inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~cs150/fa04/Lecture/xapp209.pdf},
	abstract = {Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error-checking code that is widely used in data communication systems and other serial data transmission systems. CRC is based on polynomial manipulations using modulo arithmetic. Some of the common Cyclic Redundancy Check standards are CRC-8, CRC-12, CRC-16, CRC-32, and CRC-CCIT. This application note discusses the implementation of an IEEE 802.3 CRC in a Virtexâ„¢ device. The reference design provided with this application note provides Verilog point solutions for CRC-8, CRC-12, CRC-16, and CRC-32. The Perl script (crcgen.pl) used to generate this code is also included. The script generates Verilog source for CRC circuitry of any width (8, 12, 16, 32), any polynomial, and any data input width},
