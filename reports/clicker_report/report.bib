Output  power  and  frequency  channelsare easily programmable by use of the 3-wire serial interface. Current consumption isvery  low,  only  10.5mA  at  an  output  power  of  -5dBm  and  18mA  in  receive  mode.Built-in Power Down modes makes power saving easily realizable.},

CRC is based on polynomial manipulations using modulo arithmetic. Some of the common Cyclic Redundancy Check standards are CRC-8, CRC-12, CRC-16, CRC-32, and CRC-CCIT. This application note discusses the implementation of an IEEE 802.3 CRC in a Virtex™ device. The reference design provided with this application note provides Verilog point solutions for CRC-8, CRC-12, CRC-16, and CRC-32. The Perl script (crcgen.pl) used to generate this code is also included. The script generates Verilog source for CRC circuitry of any width (8, 12, 16, 32), any polynomial, and any data input width},

Travis Goodspeed details some of the inter-workings of the Turning Point ResponseCard RF in his blog. He found out that the device always sends it’s answer to the MAC address 0x123456. Then the payload itself is preambled with the clickers MAC address and then the user input, which is ascii 0 through 9 or a question mark. Finally the packet is terminated with a 2-byte CRC.},

	abstract = {EY’s Global Immigration team is delighted to have been commissioned by the Russell Group to conduct this timely piece of research into the challengesandcostsof immigration sponsorship for both staff and students of Russell Group universities.University immigration programmes, which support overseas students and skilled migrants to come to the UK to study and work, are expected to expand if EEA and Swiss nationals are required, at a future date, to obtain permits under the UK’s Points Based System. Concern regarding the potential cost of Tier 2 and 4 sponsorship of EEA and Swiss applicants was therefore one of the catalysts behind this research.The other principal objective was to gather information, data and case studies to aid the Government’s consultation on its immigration White Paper published in December 2018.The publication of this White Paper andthe twelve-month consultation period which follows, represent a welcome opportunity to contribute to the development of immigration policy at a crucial juncture as the UK leaves the EU. We are glad to have assisted the Russell Group in this important research and trust that the findings of this report will play a useful role -informing both the consultation and future policy objectives.The UK must ensure that overseas students and university staff continue to be welcomed and supported whatever the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The universities themselves –and the immigration programmes they run –remain at the heart of this endeavou},

Royal Holloway, University of London (hereafter ‘the College’) is one of the UK’s leading research-intensive universities, with nineteen academic departments spanning the arts and humanities, social sciences and sciences.Welcomealsoto the Department of Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London.  The Department was founded in 1968, and we are proud of our fifty year contribution to the development of computing.  We teach computer science in depth, whilst keeping our programmes up to date with the latest exciting developments in consumer and business computing.This is the Undergraduate handbook for entry to the 2018-19 session.  It contains information on our degree programmes and individual course units and our teachingmethods.  You will find advice on your studies, and pointers to the many College services and guides that help students get the most out of their time with us.The Computer Science undergraduate webpage is located on the College student intranet https://intranet.royalholloway.ac.uk/computerscience/informationforcurrentstudents/home.aspx. It is where you will find important departmental policiesand programme documentation. It is updated throughout the academic year and it is a useful starting point if you are looking for information. Please make sure you are familiar with contents of these webpages.Students starting at university are often living away from home for the first time.  We understand how challenging this can be, and offer a range of services and activities to help students orientate themselves.},
