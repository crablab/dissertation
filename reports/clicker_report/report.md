# Investigation into Turning Point Clickers

At Royal Holloway, for the 2018 intake of first year undergraduates it was decided that due to the class size, paper registers were infeasible. The clicker systems was proposed and developed. This uses a Turning Technologies "Response Card" (Figure 1) typically used to respond to interactive questionnaires as part of a slideshow. The device communicates with a base station connected to a computer via USB (Universal Serial Bus) when a key option is pressed (eg. "1/A") and transmits the unique ID of the device and the key press. The message is acknowledged by the base station and the user is given visual affirmation on the device that their response was counted. The results are then stored in a semi-proprietary format attached to the slideshow which is decoded, processed and analysed by the department using a collection of scripts, Excel spreadsheets and custom software.

Whilst researching the device I discovered the work of @goodspeed_travis_2010 who reverse engineered a similar, but older device. He dumped the firmware of the device allowing him to analyse the way the device operated and how packets were structured and sent. A number of important discoveries were made. 
Firstly, @goodspeed_travis_2010  writes "The Clicker is built upon a Nordic nRF24E1 chip, which combines an 8051 microcontroller with an nRF2401 radio transceiver.". The nRF2401 is a 2.4GHz, serial radio transceiver.[@nordic_semiconductor_asa_single_2004] The datasheet lists a number of potential applications including telemetry, keyless entry and home security and automation. The chip also uses what the datasheet describes as a "3-wire serial interface." - this is otherwise know as SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) and allows easy interface with devices such as a Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
