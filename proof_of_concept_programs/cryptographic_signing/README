This is a Python 3 script, it has been run on Linux (Ubuntu) with Python version 3.6. Instructions here assume a recent version of Ubuntu. They'll probably work on Debian, if you're on Windows I would recommend using the Windows subsystem for Linux. 

1) Install Python3 and pip (the package manager) for your operating system: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
2) Use pip to install the `ecdsa` library: `pip3 install ecdsa` 
3) Use pip to install `pytest` - a testing framework: `pip3 install pytest`
4) Run `pytest tests.py` or alternatively import the library in `crypto.py` to use it directly. 

If you get PATH errors, try reloading your terminal window. If you still have issues then you're likely missing something in your PATH and you will need to manually fix that.
